# Channels

## What is a channel?
A channel is a narrow groove which has been carved or built to direct the flow of water.

* Channels have beds (or floors) and walls.
* A linear channel has a bed which is a perfect rectangle.
* Linear channels have a length, width, and height (or depth):
  * Length is the size of the bed parallel to the direction of flow.
  * Width is the size of the bed perpendicular to the direction of flow.
  * Height is the distance from the bed to the shortest wall.
