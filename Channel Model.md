# Channels

## What is a channel?
A channel is a narrow groove which has been carved or built to direct the flow of water. Each channels has a bed (or floor) and exactly 2 walls. The bed of any channel **must** be planar. There are two types of channels: Linear and Nonlinear.

### Linear Channels
* A linear channel has a bed which is a perfect rectangle.
* Linear channels have a length, width, and height (or depth):
  * Length is the size of the bed parallel to the direction of flow.
  * Width is the size of the bed perpendicular to the direction of flow.
  * Height is the distance from the bed to the shortest wall.

### Nonlinear Channels
* A nonlinear channel has a bed which is not a perfect rectangle.
* Nonlinear channels have a 
* The width of a channel from a point along a wall is the minimum chebyshev distance to the other wall.
* A nonlinear channel has at least one bottleneck if the width of the channel changes over its length.
  * The bottleneck of a nonlinear channel is found at the minimum width of the channel.
